Executable versions of this repository can also be tested using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fspaolo/captoolkit/master) and [Pangeo](https://binder.pangeo.io/v2/gh/fspaolo/captoolkit/master).

This package is under heavy development, and new tools are being added as we finish testing them (many more utilities are coming).

Currently, the individual programs work as standalone command-line utilities or editable scripts. There is no present need to install the package to run many of the programs.
