Generate and apply the inverse barometer correction (IBE) to height data.

USAGE

Convert ERA-Interim mean sea-level pressure [Pa] to inverse barometer cor [m]:

    python slp2ibe.py -a -b file.nc

Apply the IB correction to an ASCII file with x,y,t in columns 0,1,2,
and specify the time units:

    python ibecor.py -a -b file.txt


NOTES

- For ERA-Interim the point interval on the native Gaussian grid is about
  0.75 degrees (keep the native resolution grid)

- On sufficiently long time scales and away from coastal effects, the oceanâ€™s
  isostatic response is ~1 cm depression of sea level for a 1 hecto-Pascal (hPa)
  or milibar (mbar) increase in P_air (Gill, 1982; Ponte and others, 1991;
  Ponte, 1993).

- The frequency band 0.03 < w <0.5 cpd (T=2-33 days) (a.k.a. the "weather band")
  contains most of the variance in P_air. At higher frequencies, tides and
  measurement noise dominate h, and at lower frequencies, seasonal and
  climatological changes in the ice thickness and the underlying ocean state
  dominate the variability. 

- The IBE correction has generaly large spatial scales.

- There can be significant trends in P_air on time scales of 1-3 yr.

- ERA-Interim MSL pressure has time units: hours since 1900-01-01 00:00:0.0

- For MSLP we want forecast values only (without including the analyses steps)
  every 3h, so select: Times 0 and 12, Steps 3/6/9/12 

- To apply the IBE correction:

    h_cor = h - h_ibe
