This is a Python-based tidal prediction software developed following the Tidal Model Driver Matlab Toolbox, the OSU Tidal Prediction Software and the NASA GSFC PERTH3 software.  It was written and developed by Tyler C. Sutterley (tsutterl@uw.edu) from the University of Washington Applied Physics Laboratory.  The [Tidal Model Driver (TMD) Matlab Toolbox](https://www.esr.org/research/polar-tide-models/tmd-software/) was developed by Laurie Padman and Lana Erofeeva.  The [Ohio State University (OSU) Tidal Inversion Software (OTIS) and OSU Tidal Prediction Software (OTPS)](https://www.tpxo.net/otps) were developed by Lana Erofeeva and Gary Egbert ([copyright OSU](http://volkov.oce.orst.edu/tides/COPYRIGHT.pdf), licensed for non-commercial use).  The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) PREdict Tidal Heights (PERTH3) software was developed by Richard Ray and Remko Scharroo.
